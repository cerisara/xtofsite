This is post #2.

This post just shows off some [markdown][] features. Markdown is a simple HTML markup language in plain text, so it's easier to read and write.

# This is a heading

This is a reference[^1] to a footnote.

## This is a sub-heading  {#a_custom_id}

This section has a custom id on it's ``<h2>`` tag.

## This is a table

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

## Here are some definitions

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

## Some code

This is using the [Fenced Code](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Fenced_Code_Blocks) extension to markdown, but Blogofile has [it's own code filter](/blog/2009/08/29/syntax-highlight-test/) that does syntax highlighting too.

~~~~{.python}
import this
print("2 + 2 = {0}".format(2+2))
~~~~
