title: Syntax highlight test
---
This post contains some highlighted python code:

$$code(lang=python)
import this

if __name__ == "main":
    print "Hello, World!"
$$/code

This is accomplished with the built-in [syntax highlighter filter](https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/blob/master/blogofile/site_init/blog_features/_filters/syntax_highlight.py)
