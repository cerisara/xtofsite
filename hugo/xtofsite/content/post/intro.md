Nowadays, personal websites and blogs are a bit depreciated, because
everybody is posting on facebook. But a personal website is *yours*, you
control all of it from start to end. And so, you can really be proud of it,
just like when you craft a small statue with your hands.
It's just unique, it's you.

Over the years, I've tested many, many different solutions to build a website:
in particular pure html (but it's really too much work, isn't it ?)
and cms/wordpress (but you're not in control, it's heavy, no git, full of
vulnerabilities...).
And I've come to a single conclusion: there is really nothing like static web
site generators: sites are fast, not vulnerable, modern-looking, git-friendly,
and you're the boss. period.
