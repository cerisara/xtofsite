This is the new page of the JSafran software, with a Java Web Start link
to automatically install JSafran on your computer, along with all its dependencies.
<br>
The previous installation mode is more complex (see <a href="http://rapsodis.loria.fr/jsafran/index.html">old JSafran page</a>) because it requires you to download and uncompress all resources manually.
<br>
This Java Web Start solution should be way easier for you to test JSafran.
If you are interested by the source code, I distribute it freely through a public GIT repo (see the old page above),
which pitifully is never up-to-date. I have a private GIT repo with the last (unstable) version. Please contact
me if you want to access it.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Clic here to install and run JSafran:<a href="jsafranappli.jnlp">jsafran</a></h2>
<br>
The installer will be put a few files (less than 10) and 2 directories in your HOME directory.
<br>
<br>
Warning ! Installation will download about 150Mb from the internet, so please be sure to have
a good enough connection, and at least 200Mb free space on your disk !
It also requires at least 1Gb of RAM.
You also have to have a java 1.6 plugin installed in your browser.
If your browser does not launch automatically the .jnlp file, then you can also download the .jnlp
file and run it from the command-line with javaws.
<br>
<br>
The installer will warn you that JSafran may be harmful to your computer: this is a standard safeguard
warning for all Java Web Start applications. You can safely accept it: I am a researcher working for a public
French research institute (CNRS) and within a recognized public laboratory (LORIA): I have no interest in delivering
malicious software. Furthermore, all my code is open-source, so you can check it, and I guarantee that the code
is free of any type of ad-ware, spy-ware, virus, etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>

I think installing JSafran is now much easier than before. Nice.
But I acknowledge that there is still a real lack of documentation for JSafran:
the documentation you may find on older pages is most often obsolete; that's because I don't have time to write
and keep up-to-date a real documentation. I'm sorry for this !
Please contact me and ask me in case you're really in trouble, or, even better, if you want to participate in
writing a piece of code or documentation (in some kind of wiki that has to be installed).

<h1>Latest News</h1>
JSafran includes now both English and French models (Tree tagger and MATE parser).
<br>
The English parsing models have been trained on the Conll'08 training corpus.
These models give LAS=85.8% and UAS=88.1% on the test-WSJ of Conll'08, with POS-tags obtained from the TreeTagger.
<br>
There are two French models: one trained on the French Treebank (written text), and another trained on the Ester Treebank
(speech transcripts).
