JTrans
==================
JTrans is a software that is primarily designed to bring speech alignment (and by extension speech recognition) technology
right to the user, and ready to use. No need to be speech technology expert to use JTrans.

JTrans only works in French for now.

JTrans is open-source, and is version-controlled under GIT.

JTrans source code is now available in GitHub:
