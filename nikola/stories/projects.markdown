I'm currently involved in the following projects:  


### ORTOLANG

Our role in this project is to process large corpora in French with syntactic and semantic tools.
These corpora will be maintained in a stable state and diffused with a guarantee of at least 10 years.

### ContNomina

Our role in this project is to improve the performances of named entity recognition through the use of unsupervised structural learning.

### ORFEO

We're participating in this project in collaboration with the Parole team to build and process large French textual and speech resources 
that shall be made freely available. Our role is to process these resources with different NLP components.
