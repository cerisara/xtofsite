Speech recognition
==================
JTrans is a software that is primarily designed to bring speech alignment (and by extension speech recognition) technology
right to the user, and ready to use. No need to be speech technology expert to use JTrans.

Download the (small) core application here: [jtrans.jar](http://talc1.loria.fr/users/cerisara/jtrans.jar)

Note that when run the first time, this application will download a huge quantity of data (about 1Gb): these are
the acoustic models, phonetic lexicons, language models and phonetisation models.

JTrans only works in French for now.

JTrans is open-source, and is version-controlled under GIT. Please contact me to have access to the (undocumented, very fuzzy) source code.

More details here: [jtrans page](jtrans.html)
