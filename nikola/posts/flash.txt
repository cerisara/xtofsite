.. title: Update your flash plugin for firefox
.. slug: flash

If you are using linux with firefox, you may sometimes see a warning when trying
to play some flash website about your flash plugin being vulnerable because outdated.

Updating your plugin is relatively easy:

* First, follow the given ling to the Adobe site to download the last plugin version.
  I suggest downloading the .tar.gz version of the plugin.
* Then, unzip this archive in a fresh directory: you'll find a file called something like *libflashplugin.so*
* You just have to copy this file to the right place. In order to know where, launch firefox and go to "about:plugins".
  You'll see a list of plugin, look for the Flash plugin: the directory of the plugin file is given.
* Just copy/override the previous .so file in this directory by the new one, restart firefox: you're done !
