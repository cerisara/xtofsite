.. title: New gitlab continuous integration server
.. slug: gitlab1

A new *continuous integration* server has been installed on TALC2: it is integrated with the gitlab main server.

What is continuous integration ?
================================

*Continuous integration* is an approach that automates testing and deployment of your code.
It is extremely useful because it saves you hours of debugging, by identifying bugs very early.
It is one of the preferred software development approach in the field of Agile/Test-driven paradigm.

Its use is extremely simple:

* You first have to write tests in your code that can run automatically and quickly. They are typically unit tests
  that check on small artificial datasets that various parts of your code return the correct values.
* Then, you have to create a new project on the gitlab-ci server here: http://talc2.loria.fr:8889
  by importing your project from the gitlab server; you can use your gitlab login to connect.
* Then, whenever your "git push" some modification in your code onto the gitlab server, your software will be automatically 
  re-deployed on TALC2 and your tests will be run automatically; the outcome (success or fail) shows up on the project webpage,
  and you can configure the server to send emails, or RSS in case of failure.

This approach forces you to write a really self-contained software and self-evaluating tests, which may look a bit annoying at
first sight. But this is actually the main advantage of this approach, because this is the only way to really reduce the
amounts of bugs, and to greatly improve maintainability of your code.

I will post more details about it later on if needed.
