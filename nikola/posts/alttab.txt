I don't like the way Ubuntu 14 handles the Alt-Tab window switching shortcut,
because it switches windows across desktops, while I prefer to stay within the
same desktop when switching.

One way to disable this across-desktop switching is to launch ccsm
and then disable the "Viewport Switcher".
At least this option worked for me.
