.. title: Backup your GIT repos on talc1
.. slug: git_backup

If you use our git server on TALC1, don't forget that nothing is saved !
It shouldn't be a problem in case of a crash of TALC1, because your local copies of
your repositories are self-contained and can be used to recreate new server copies.

But you have to be cautious to always keep at least one local copy of all your repositories.
In the case of old repositories that you have not touched from several months/years, you may not have
anymore a local copy of them.

So I suggest you to run from time to time the following script, which lists all of the repositories
you have access to and clone them locally (in bare format to reduce space; I assume that you have your SSH config setup):

    #!/bin/tcsh
    
    set LOCALDIR = "/home/somehwere/myEmptyBackupDir"
    
    mkdir -p $LOCALDIR
    
    ssh gittalc1 expand > /tmp/tt
    
    tail -n +3 /tmp/tt | awk '{aa=$NF; sub(/\\//,"-",aa); print "git clone --bare gittalc1:"$NF" '$LOCALDIR'/"aa}' > /tmp/tt.sh
    
    tcsh /tmp/tt.sh
